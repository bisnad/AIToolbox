Several motion capture recordings of dancers are provided as part of the AI-Toolbox. These recordings capture some of idiosyncratic dance principles employed by the dance company [Instituto Stocos](https://www.stocos.com/). 

Currently, the following types recordings are available. 

Movement qualities for a solo dancer.
