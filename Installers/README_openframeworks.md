# AI-Toolbox - Installers - openFrameworks

A few tools are written in C++ and make use of the [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) creative coding environment. openFrameworks is an open-source community-driven project and runs on a variety of hardware platforms and operating systems including Linux, Windows, and MacOS. In the case of the AI-Toolbox, installing openFrameworks is only necessary when the user plans to compile the tools on his or her own. 

## Installing openFrameworks

Currently, the C++ tools are not compatible with the most recent version of openFrameworks and instead require version 0.11.2. This older version can be downloaded from the [version archive](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/releases/tag/0.11.2). The installation procedure is very simple and consists of unpacking the downloaded openFrameworks archive only. To compile C++ programs that make use of openFrameworks requires the availability of a C++ IDE such as XCode (on MacOS) or Visual Studio (on Windows). 

Installation instructions for the individual C++ tools are provided as part of the documentation of these tools.
