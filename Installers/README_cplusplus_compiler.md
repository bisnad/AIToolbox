# AI-Toolbox - Installers - C++ compiler

A toolchain to compile C++ programs is required for two reasons: to install some Python packages through the pip package manager and to compile those AT-Toolbox tools that make use of the Openframeworks creative coding environment. 

The simplest approach to install a C++ compiler toolchain is by installing the software development IDEs provided by Apple for MacOS and by Microsoft for Windows. In the case of Apple, the IDE is XCode, in the case of Windows, it is Visual Studio. 

## Installing XCode

An Apple developer account is required to download and install XCode. Such an account can be created for free [here](https://account.apple.com/account?appId=632&returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.apple.com%2Fdownload%2F). When your account is active, you can download XCode from [here](https://developer.apple.com/download/applications/). 

## Installing Visual Studio

Visual Studio community edition can be used for free and is available for download from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). When running the installer, make sure to set to chose "Desktop development with C++" under the Workloads tab. To run Visual Studio, it needs to be linked to your Microsoft account. If you don't have such an account, you can create it [here](https://account.microsoft.com/account/Account).
